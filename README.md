This project focuses on "IMPLEMENTING STACK AND QUEUE OPERATIONS ON LINKEDLIST USING GUI"
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Write a program using JCF (single java file based project with java file name as linklist) to achieve the following:
Write a program that randomly stores 10 integer numbers (to start with) in a LinkedList object. Using this LinkedList object, implement stack and queue operations using GUI as follows: Add 2 Radio Buttons for choosing options (a) Stack and (b) Queue, and 4 JButtons (Push, Pop for Stack, and Add, Delete for Queue).
Once you run the program, it should display a LinkedList of 10 random integers in a text field. You should then be able to choose a radio button of either Stack or Queue, followed by one of its operations (Push or Pop Buttons for Stack ONLY, and Add or Delete Buttons for Queue ONLY (Invalid choices like choosing Stack followed by pressing ADD button should not work). The program should then display the modified list (as per the operation undertaken) in the text field.
